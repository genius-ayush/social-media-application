<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]]

I wanted to use the react fundamentals that I have learned from my react pokedex project (hosted on my github), as well as the fullstack fundamentals that I learned from creating my campgrounds viewing web application (hosted on github as well), to create a fullstack social media platform site. I will add more features as I learn more about web development, and hopefully others can learn from this project as well.
